# Travel Website - Discover Tanzania Milestone Project 2

[View my live website here] ()

I have developed this project aimed to showcase a few tourists attractions available in Tanzania in order to encourage people to visit and explore Tanzania. 
The website has 3 pages; Landing/home page, About page, Attraction page and Contact page. The main goal for these pages is to give people a brief summary of Tanzania and what
the country has to offer, which includes the beautiful national parks, mountain Kilimanjaro and the beautiful Island of Zanzibar amongest many. 

The website has been designed to be fully responsive and accessible on different devices i.e. (mobile, desktop and tablet), In order to allow easy navigation for people visiting the website 
and find required information.
